# Job Listing Web Application

## Overview

This project is a simple web-based job listing and detail viewer application. It consists of:

- **Index page:** Displays a list of job openings, retrieved dynamically from an external JSON data file.
- **Details page:** Shows comprehensive details about a selected job from the list.
- **External JSON file:** Centralized data source for all job listings to allow easy updating and sharing between pages.

***

## Features

- Loads job data asynchronously from a JSON file (`jobs-data.json`).
- Shows a clickable list of jobs, each with job title, company, category, location, job type, and industry links.
- Clicking a job opens the details page with full job description, responsibilities, requirements, salary, remote work info, and application instructions.
- Accessibility-friendly markup with ARIA roles and labels.
- Clean, responsive design for both list and details views.
- "Easy Apply" button with a confirmation message.
- External JSON file allows easy updates without touching the core HTML/JS code.

## Project Structure

```
/project-folder
│
├── index.html          # Job listing page showing all jobs
├── details.html        # Job details page for selected job
├── jobs-data.json      # External JSON data file containing all job listings
└── README.md           # This documentation file
```

***

## Setup and Usage

1. **Download or clone** the project files into a folder.

2. **Serve the files with a local HTTP server** to avoid browser CORS restrictions when loading JSON:  
   For example, run in terminal (if Python is installed):  
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
   and open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your web browser.

3. **View the job listings on `index.html`.**

4. **Click on any job** in the list to open `details.html` showing that job’s full details.
